### Mininet VM in VirtualBox Method ###
#######################################

The aim is to run the Mininet VM and allow ssh into the VM
from the host machine.

1.  Install VirtualBox and download the Mininet image.
Sources:
http://mininet.org/download/
https://github.com/mininet/mininet/releases/

2.  Allow the host machine to ssh into the Mininet VM.
First do VM network setup, there are 2 options:
i) Attach Adapter 1 on VM to 'Bridged Adapter':
   In this mode, a virtual switch is added between the host's
   network interface (e.g. enp6s0) and the VM's virtual interface
   (Adapter 1).  This means the VM is added to the same subnet as
   the host's network interface (enp6s0).

   For example, if 'ifconfig' on the host says:

    enp6s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.101  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255

   Then the VM will get an IP address like 192.168.1.104 (check using 'ifconfig'
   inside the VM).  Other noteworthy settings:

   Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Server (82545EM)
   Promiscuous Mode: Allow All
