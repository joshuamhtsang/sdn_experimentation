### Running Mininet ###
#######################

Theoretically, running Mininet is simple:
1.  SSH into the VM (see guide 'setup-mininet-vm.txt').
2.  Run mininet with sudo privileges:
     $ sudo mn
3.  Open a terminal in one of the hosts:
     $ xterm h1

However, you may get the following error when running xterm
in mn:

mininet> xterm h1
mininet> X11 connection rejected because of wrong authentication.

This is because 'mn' is run as root using sudo, and SSH's '-X'
is made as user 'mininet'.  To fix this, the root user must be
given the xauth cookie belonging to user 'mininet'.  Please note
that a new cookie is created each time a SSH session is created,
so the following steps need to be performed each time SSH session
is created.

1.  Get the xauth cookie of the user 'mininet':
    - SSH into the mininet VM and run:
    $ whoami
    mininet
    $ touch ~/.Xauthority
    $ xauth list
    mininet-vm/unix:10  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  6c939ed0602efaf619b57de7dda1252a

2.  Enter root mode and add the cookie to xauth:
    $ sudo -s
    $ xauth add mininet-vm/unix:10  MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1  6c939ed0602efaf619b57de7dda1252a
    $ exit

3.  Now run 'mn' and:
    $ xterm h1
    Should now work.
