### Mininet VM in VirtualBox Method ###
#######################################

The aim is to run the Mininet VM and allow SSH into the VM
from the host machine.

1.  Install VirtualBox and download the Mininet image.
Sources:
http://mininet.org/download/
https://github.com/mininet/mininet/releases/

2.  Allow the host machine to ssh into the Mininet VM.
First do VM network setup, there are 2 options:
i) Attach Adapter 1 on VM to 'Bridged Adapter':
   In this mode, a virtual switch is added between the host's
   network interface (e.g. enp6s0) and the VM's virtual interface
   (Adapter 1).  This means the VM is added to the same subnet as
   the host's network interface (enp6s0).

   For example, if 'ifconfig' on the host says:

    enp6s0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.101  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255

   Then the VM will get an IP address like 192.168.1.104 (check using 'ifconfig'
   inside the VM).  Other noteworthy settings:

   Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Server (82545EM)
   Promiscuous Mode: Allow All

   Using this mode, you can SSH from the host into the VM by:
   $ ssh -X mininet@<IP_address_inside_vm>
   password is 'mininet'.

ii)Attach Adapter 1 on VM to 'NAT':
   In this mode, a virtual router is added between the host's network
   interface (e.g. enp6s0) and the VM's network interface (Adapter 1).
   This means the VM can access the internet, but the host or nodes
   outside the VM's subnet (or equivalently, behind the virtual router)
   cannot access/see the VM unless port forwarding is set up.

   Port forward settings to allow SSH into the VM are:
   Forwarding rule name:  ssh (can be anything)
   Protocol: TCP
   Host Port: 3022 (or any free port)
   Guest Port: 22 (SSH's default port)
   Leave all other fields blank.

   You can SSH from the host into the VM by:
   $ ssh -X mininet@127.0.0.1:3022

   127.0.0.1 is the host's loopback IP address.

3. Run the virtual machine and SSH into the Mininet VM as described above.
   The '-X' argument is required because 'xterm' will be used to invoke
   terminals in the hosts virtualized by Mininet.
